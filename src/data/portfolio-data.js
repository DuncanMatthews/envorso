        caseStudyOverview: "New regulations such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe’s R156, are requiring manufacturers to certify the process by which they develop, install and update software. The aim of these regulations is to safeguard the interest of customers and other drivers by preventing unauthorized access to software and features installed inside vehicles. To get certified, an OEM must go through an audit readiness phase which culminates in a formal audit by a recognized global certifying organization. Here’s how Envorso worked with one global automotive manufacturer to get them certified.          ",
        solution: "Many different technical organizations within the OEM needed to work together in order to ensure a successful audit. Envorso provided a subject matter expert with audit experience, who pulled together what was needed to complete an audit. The team provided weekly high-level reports to management.",

There were no clear vehicle and manufacturing targets or objectives defined for the “start of production.”  The team lacked a progressive plan to take the vehicle from an early prototype phase into production.",
        solution: `Envorso provided an experienced program leader that had previously delivered three JD Power IQ Awards for a competitive OEM. The work began by defining clear targets and objectives for the “start of production.” Then, they worked back through the various build phases and established reasonable targets and objectives for each milestone event.  

        We developed and delivered a comprehensive Launch Quality Plan from verification prototype to start of production. The plan included specific Milestone Events, T&DM Cadence, and the method to collate and prioritize the Jira issues identified in the process. The system created measured the harmony between the design and manufacturing process.  A score card system was developed to measure program health. Envorso also designed and staffed an organization to work on the new vehicle launch.  `,

Envorso quickly established a permanent solution that saved the company $4 million and returned more than $20 million of supplier overpayments to the company in the first 18 months of operation.
